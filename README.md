Real-time pump scheduling in water distribution networks using deep reinforcement learning

Pump scheduling in water distribution networks influences energy efficiency and water supply reliability. Conventional optimization methods usually face challenges in intensive computational requirements and water demand uncertainty handling. This study presents a deep reinforcement learning method, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), for real-time pump scheduling in water distribution networks. The PPO agents are trained to develop off-line policies in advance, avoiding the online optimization process during the scheduling period. 

The PPO algorithm is provided by https://github.com/Lizhi-sjtu/DRL-code-pytorch/tree/main/5.PPO-continuous
